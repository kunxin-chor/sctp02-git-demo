# A repo is a collection of files that are tracked together

What can Git do?
1. Track changes to your repo (create new files, delete files and update content in files)
2. Create a version of our project (something like a checkpoint or a milestone) and store it in Git
   * Stage the files (aka mark which files will go into the next version)
   * Commit (finalize the files for the next version and create it)
